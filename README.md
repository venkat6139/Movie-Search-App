# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Movie Search App
A React application that allows users to search for movies using the Open Library API and displays random dog images for each movie card.

# Features
Search for movies using the Open Library Search API
Display movie details along with a random dog image for each movie card
Responsive design with attractive UI
Loading indicator while fetching data
Error handling for failed API requests

# Prerequisites
Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)

# Components
App.js: The main component that handles the state of the application and renders the search bar, loader, movie list, and error messages.

SearchBar: A component that contains the search bar where users can enter a movie name.

MovieList: A component that renders a list of movie cards.

MovieCard: A component that displays movie details and a random dog image.

Loader: A component that displays a loading spinner.

Api: Contains functions to fetch movie data from the Open Library API and random dog images from the Dog CEO API.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
